# SJSU CS46B (Intro to Data Structures and Alogirthms) Pokemon Dictionary Project
This is my PokemonDictionary project from CS46B (Intro to Data Structures and Algorithms) @ SJSU. This project reads Pokemon data from a given .csv file and creates Pokemon objects and sorts them based off of various criteria. 

``You only need to download the pokemonProj.jar file if you want to run the project (see How to Run) 
``If you only want to view the code, check the pokemonDictionary folder instead``

# Goal
The goal of this project was to implement CSV file reading combined with knowledge of Data Structures in order to sort and categorize Pokemon character data

- Make sure you have Java installed on your computer 
  - Windows: Open the command prompt and type ``java -version``
  - Mac/Linux: Open the terminal and type ``java -version``

- Download the ``pokemonProj.jar`` file
- On your command prompt / ternimal, navigate to the directory where ``pokemonProj.jar`` is located.
- Use the command ``java -jar pokemonProj.jar`` to run the project
